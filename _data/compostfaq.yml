    Rust Belt Riders aims to work with commerical food waste producers by working directly with those who are working to pepare meals. There we will outline the approved items that we can recieve. These include; fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshels, and unbleached paper. While some commerical composting facilities can take a wider range of materials, we seek to ensure that our food waste is going back to local food production in our community.

    At this time Rust Belt Riders cannnot accept meat, fish, bones, dairy, corn-based bio-plastics or anything coated in oil. Beacuse we partner with EPA certified facilities and community farms/ gardens we strive to meet their standards. While meat, fish, bones, dairy and corn-based bio-plastics can be composted, we do not presently have partnerships with any facilities that can presently process these materials. If you think of your compost pile as a vegan, everything should be A-Okay!

    Food should be used to feed people, not land fills. When you initiate services with Rust Belt Riders you are ensuring that your wasted food has another life. Food waste can be used in a variety of ways; feeding hungry people, feeding animals that feed us, compost, and energy production. We specialize in compost but if your company is interested in any specific diversion strategy our network can support your need. We work with food shelters, farmers, and anerobic digestion companies to ensure your wasted food is being used just how you'd like!
